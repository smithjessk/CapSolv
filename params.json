Also, this probably won't work for other systems until we do some Make surgery. \r\n\r\nTo run the classification pipeline on an image, navigate to /src/ and run:\r\n\r\n    $ ./process {{your relative image path}}\r\n\r\n## Pipeline\r\n\r\n1. Read in the image in grayscale\r\n2. Threshold the image to binary, with the boundary intensity being 1.25 standard deviations below the mean intensity (see [the OpenCV documentation](http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/imgproc/threshold/threshold.html); we use <code>cv::THRESH_BINARY</code>)\r\n3. Find and record the contours in the image\r\n4. For each contour, compute its descriptors (from Histogram of Ordered Gradients)\r\n5. Pass each contour's descriptors to the Support Vector Machine and obtain a character (e.g., 0, a, +, integral sign)\r\n6. Parse the expression\r\n7. Return the resulting string\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\nFor any questions or comments, feel free to email <smith.jessk@gmail.com> or <jonathanmclaus@gmail.com>.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
